# 8BitKings Animation
Simple animation system for gamemaker. Work with sprites as if in an object but without the object.

In the repo you can find the scr_animation.gml which is the single script that you want, there is also the .yymps file which is a local package you can import into gamemaker.
Furthermore there is an Animation Examples which contains a Game Maker Project that shows you what this can do.
